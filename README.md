Known Issues:

In the main menu, if you click on the right arrow to change classes then you can't click play
Sometimes teleporting can happen unexpectedly
Bullet Riding on occasion


Things to work on/think about:

Meter to know shooting cooldown
Improve health points visual
Change power ups to be a health reset exclusively
Potential slow orb debuff

If we make more maps, consider how different classes will interact and be strong or weak.
Maps should not feel the same as each other. 
Assassin Class should have a burst fire
